The structure of this document is based on the industrial standard CRISP-DM (CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining).  However, since this is an academic project for a university exam, the Evaluation and Deployment phases will not be performed, as it is unnecessary to extend the process beyond model development and technical assessment.
